// 1. Concatenation allows you to combine to strings together and it only works on two strings. Swift uses string interpolation to include the name of a constant or variable as a placeholder in a longer string, and to prompt Swift to replace it with the current value of that constant or variable.
// ex. let str = "Hi, my name is "
// Dry = "dont repeat yourself" it can stop your code.
//Declaring a variable sets it up to be used at a later point in the code.
//`const` is a signal that the identifier wonâ€™t be reassigned.
//`let`, is a signal that the variable may be reassigned,
// parent directory is the main folder holding the children
// in terminal type "man unix"
// tab complests your words. saves tons of time
